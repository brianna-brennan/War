[WAR](hhttps://brianna-brennan.github.io/War/) is an JavaScript, HTML, and CSS card game. You will be competing against the computer in a game of luck. The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. To start the game, click on the “Draw Card” button. A card will be drawn for each player at the same time and the player with the higher card gets a point. If the cards are the same rank, its War and neither player gets a point.
